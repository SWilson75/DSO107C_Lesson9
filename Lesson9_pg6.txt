Lesson 9 pg.6 
Making Commits
Ok, now start making some additions to your repo and see what 
happens. 
*	First, create a new file in the directory where you cloned the 
repo.  You will start with something really simple - a text file. 
o	But know that you can create any kind of file in the folder 
on your computer where your repo lives.  It could be a R 
Studio Script, a Python .ipynb, or even a Power Point.
Tip!
You can also drag and drop or copy in existing files to your repo this 
way as well - just like any other file folder on your computer.
*	In this case, you will create a text file named newFile.txt. While 
you are here, change something in the README.md file that 
was part of the initial commit.
